## Usage scenarios

Sam is an economics teacher at a high school in Vancouver. In preparation to teach a module in macro socio-economics, he wants to introduce his class to real world data and have them challenge and discuss ideas about how the world is perceived.

He wants them to be able to [explore] a dataset that can [summarize] important trends and contextualize data to improve his student’s interpretations of the world. It’s also important that they are able to [compare] different variables across different countries and regions as this will help to provoke useful discussions. [Identifying] outliers and pivotal points in time will also be beneficial to help his students consolidate class work. For example, by observing the number of children born per woman over time they should be able to see that the numbers start to decline suddenly from the 1960s, and is now down to less than three. He hopes that he can use this as an analytical exercise that will in turn inspire his students to explore this trend further.

Sam is excited by the idea of being able to filter the data by various metrics that he has already discussed with his class (child mortality, children born per woman, life expectancy). He is happy that the dashboard is not too complicated and the application is easy and functional to demonstrate in class. The dashboard will be a beneficial tool and learning resource for his students.
