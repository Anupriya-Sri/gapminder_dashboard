# Proposal

## Motivation and purpose

### Why are creating this dashboard?

The objective is to investigate what the young population of students know and don't know about basic global patterns and macro-trends and educate the intended users on global development trends. This dashboard has been developed to communicate insights about historical social/economic trends and create a better understanding of using and teaching statistics.

### Who is the target audience, and what role are we embodying?

This dashboard is designed to be an educational tool. Hence we are targeting the below audience.

- **Students** 
  Gapminder provides reliable statistics for nearly every aspect of global development, such as population growth, life expectancy, standard of living, etc. Students can interact with this rich data using this dashboard to get a better picture of the progress made on global development over time. These interactions should empower the students and help change their perceptions of the global world. Also, students will realize the importance of using statistics to investigate issues like global development and can utilize the skills learned in this endeavour in other aspects of their academic lives.

- **Educators**
  Educators can use the dashboard as a tool for educating their student on the trends in global development and for teaching statistics. They can also use this dashboard to explain the optimal use of data visualization.

### What problem could this dashboard solve for the intended user?

This dashboard intends to educate with a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand and help the user overcome misconceptions and develop a better understanding of statistics.

## Description of the data

The gapminder dataset is collected and maintained by Gapminder.org, a non-for-profit organization trying to eliminate social misconceptions from our societies. For this project, we have focused on a subset of nine (9) social parameters which we wanted to analyse. Data on these selected parameters is available from the year 1800 to 2018, and is collected at country level. Overall, there are 38982 observations. The description of columns in dataset is given below:

## Usage Scenario

Sam is an economics teacher at a high school in Vancouver. In preparation to teach a module in macro socio-economics, he wants to introduce his class to real world data and have them challenge and discuss ideas about how the world is perceived.

He wants them to be able to [explore] a dataset that can [summarize] important trends and contextualize data to improve his student’s interpretations of the world. It’s also important that they are able to [compare] different variables across different countries and regions as this will help to provoke useful discussions. [Identifying] outliers and pivotal points in time will also be beneficial to help his students consolidate class work. For example, by observing the number of children born per woman over time they should be able to see that the numbers start to decline suddenly from the 1960s, and is now down to less than three. He hopes that he can use this as an analytical exercise that will in turn inspire his students to explore this trend further.

Sam is excited by the idea of being able to filter the data by various metrics that he has already discussed with his class (child mortality, children born per woman, life expectancy). He is happy that the dashboard is not too complicated and the application is easy and functional to demonstrate in class. The dashboard will be a beneficial tool and learning resource for his students.
