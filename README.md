The landing page of the dashboard is designed to have five filters at the left, for selecting the target of the study, second factor of study, continent , country and the year range (1960 to 2018) .The line chart at the top is a trend-plot showing the change of the target of the study during the time over the years for the selected country, average of the continent and average of the whole world. So user would be able to compare these trend with each other. In the top right corner, there is a bubble chart which visualize the target study versus the second factor of study for all the countries.
