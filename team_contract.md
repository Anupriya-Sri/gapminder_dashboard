# Team work contract

## Meetings

- Tuesday 2-4pm lab session
  - Work through milestones
  - Discuss progress
  - Run through individual issues or questions
- Friday 10-11.30am each week
  - Quick run through of what youâ€™ve been doing
  - What you aim to do before saturday deadline

All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.

## Communication

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github.
Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work.
Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings. Updating on workload or when PRs are ready to be reviewed. Updates on availability

## Reviews

We have changed the settings on our Github PRs to have at least one approval and review before merging into our main branch.

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate.

Once a PR is no longer in draft and has been assigned a reviewer, it is expected for this PR to be looked at and closed within 24 hours.

## Quality

In order to ensure quality of our work and codebase we will adhere to coding best practices which include useful github messages which can be found here:

## Deadlines

Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The proof-reader will review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
